#
# This file contains a simple list of vocabularies that we bundle together to
# form the collective set of LIT 'Common' vocabularies.
#
# These are the vocabs that we feel will be the most commonly used across
# general RDF development efforts, and so we list them here to allow our 
# artifact generators to create programming-language-specific bundles
# providing convenient constants representing the terms from these 
# vocabularies.
#
# For example, for Java developers we can generate a single JAR, or for
# JavaScript we can generate a single NPM module, that developers can depend
# on directly and easily get immediate access to source-code constants for all
# the terms in all of these vocabularies.
#
# Local vocabularies can be provided relative to the location of this resource
# list file.
#
# NOTE: THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WE GENERATE THE ACTUAL LIT-COMMON ARTIFACT
# (as of August 2019). WE DO *NOT* APPLY OUR EXTENSIONS HERE FOR VOCABS LIKE
# Schema.org, OR VCard (OR INCLUDE LOCAL REFERENCES TO VOCABS THAT DON'T HAVE
# TURTLE SERIALIZATIONS (LIKE the VANN OR HTTP VOCABS) AS WE'D NEED TO
# REFERENCE THOSE EXTENSIONS FROM HERE, WHICH WOULD TIE US TO THEIR RELATIVE
# POSITION ON THE FILE SYSTEM.
